## Learning objectives

You will learn how to:

+ [Sort rows](#sort-rows)
+ [Select then order rows](#select-sort-rows)
+ [Select a subset of columns](#subsetting-columns)
+ [Select a subset of rows and columns](#subsetting-rows-and-columns)

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
data <- gapminder
data$row_no <- 1:nrow(data)
```

## Sort rows

You are now familiar with `dplyr` commands and the pipe syntax. A second type of manipulation is the ordering of your data. For this, we will use the command `arrange()`.

The command `arrange()` changes the order of the rows. The argument is a set of column names to order by. 

```{r}
data %>% arrange(country) %>% head(10)
```

If you provide more than one column name, the column names are separated with commas.Each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns. 

```{r}
data %>% arrange(continent, country, year) %>% head()
```

Use desc() to re-order by a column in descending order:

```{r}
data %>% arrange(desc(continent), country) %>% head()
```

## Chaining data treatments: selecting and sorting rows {#select-sort-rows}

You have been introduced to the chaining of commands. It is now time to start to feel the advantages of this way of writing commands. 

For exemple, let's select the data of year 2007 and the African continent. Sort the results  in descending order of GDP and show the first 5 results.

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa", year ==2007) %>%
  arrange(-gdpPercap) %>%
  slice_head(n=6)
```

_Note that this becomes very easy to follow the succesive data treatments. Beside, with that solution you do not need an intermediate variable._


## Select columns/variables {#subsetting-columns}

When you have a large survey with many variables, it will often be useful to extract the specific variables useful for a particular type of analysis. 

The function `select()` will allow you do create a subset of variables based on their names.

### column positions
A first approach is to list the column positions.  

```{r}
data %>% select(1, 3, 6) 
```

However, this is not really recommended as the order of your columns could change, and lead to unexpected manipulations.

### Column names

A second approach is to list all the names of the variables you want to select
```{r}
data %>% select(country, year, gdpPercap) %>% slice_head(n=4)
```

However, it can become rapidly cumbersome to have to write a long list of variable names. Hopefully, you can use a few tricks.

#### Select ranges of variables
You can provide a range of variables or a range of column positions

```{r}
# This will select of the variables between the column continent and pop
data %>% select(continent:pop) %>% head(4)
```

### Exclude instead of selecting
If you need to select most variables and exclude only a few variables you can use the sign `-` to signal the variables you want to exclude:

```{r}
data %>% select(-gdpPercap) %>% head(4) 
```

#### Select by type

You can select the variables by their type or any other characteristic using `where()`. 

`where()` applies a function to all variables and selects those for which the function returns TRUE.

```{r}
# will select only the numeric variables
data %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% head(5)
```


#### Use additional helpers on variable names
To make your life easier, you can also use a number of helper function within select

```{r}
# Select of the variables with names starting with C
data %>% select(starts_with("c"))
```

```{r}
# Select of the variables with names containing O
data %>% select(contains("O"))
```

It was probably not convincing with such an exemple, but imagine that you have a data set with information collected at different time, and you have variables such as x2000, x2001, x2002, x2003

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Presented for reference only, we do not have variables x2000, x2001, x2002, x2003!
data %>% select(starts_with("x"))
```

#### Use a combination of these strategies

Note that you can mix the strategies to obtain a list of variables. For example, you want to select the row_no and year variables and the variables containing "O". 

```{r}
data %>% select(row_no, year, contains("o")) %>% head(5)
```

### Reordering columns

Sometimes, you just want to re-order the variables. Indeed you can do this with select, but it can still be cumbersome if you need to move only a few among many colmuns.

In such case you can use the function `relocate()`. 

The default behaviour corresponds to the case where you want to move some variables to the front:

```{r}
# this will make the row_no variable as the first colum
data %>% relocate(row_no) %>% head(3)
```

Use the function helper if you need more sophisticated changes.


## Selecting rows and columns {#subsetting-rows-and-columns}

You have all the tools to select rows and columns.
Using tidyverse, you will chain each activities. For example, you want to select the column country and pop, and consider only the African countries:

```{r}
data %>% filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
  select(country, pop)
```

Note that the order of the commands can be important. In our example, we selected the row where continent was "Africa" and then selected two variables country and pop. Imagine what would happen if you interchange the two commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data %>%  select(country, pop) %>%
  filter(continent == "Africa") 
```
