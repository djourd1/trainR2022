This section will give you the basics to get started with R.

It is structured in two chapters:

+ In the first chapter you will install R and R Studio software and write your first lines of R code.
+ In the second chapter you will be introduced to the main data types and data structures.

If you already have experience with R and R Studio, you can move on to the next section without any problems.
